    <h1> Next: Illustrator </h1>
    
    <h2>
        This was what I was looking forward to the most as illustration has always been a branch of graphic design that I've taken an interest in. Having only limited experince with this program, this was a little challenging. The outcome of the piece was not how I would want it but it's not as worse as it could have been. I definitely would like to come back to this piece in the future and do a updated version once my skill level has increased.
