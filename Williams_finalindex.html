    <h1> Introduction </h1>
    
    <h2>
        My name is Brianni Williams. I'm taking VMD 105 as a step into my Graphic Design career. By taking this class, it has actually helped me to figure out what branch of the graphic design industry that I might want to go into. Surpringly, one of my favorite things that I've learned was HTML and CSS. Never thought this would interest me before but seeing the very bones of a website and how it is made is something I want to look into and also makes me want to look into coding. I hope to take what I've learned from this class and grow my digital design skills. Please check out the work that I've done and give me feedback through my social media!
